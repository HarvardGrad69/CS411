CS 411 Final Project

Crime Detection is a web application that uses over 50,000+ entries of crime recorded in Chicago over the period of 5 years.
This application uses visualization and maps to understand the nature of crime and where specifically it has occured in Chicago.
A user can use this application to get information about crimes in their neighbourhood of interest and it opens doors to understanding where to live for travel, permanent stay etc.
